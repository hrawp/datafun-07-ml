Machine Learning

This project will use machine learning to create a model and run that model to make a predicition.

## Question about Classes, Atributes, Methods, and
Besides DataFrame, list another class widely used in data analytics:

Another widely used class in data analytics is the Series class from the pandas library. A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, and it's often used for handling and analyzing one-dimensional data.

Give an example of an attribute (data) stored in the class

ChatGPT
In the Series class, one common attribute is the index. The index provides labels for each element in the Series, allowing for easy data retrieval and alignment.

For example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series
data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])

# Accessing the index attribute
print(data.index)
In this example, the index attribute would output: Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='object').

Give an example of a class method (function) that operates on that data:
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A common class method that operates on the Series class is the .sum() method. This method calculates the sum of the values in the Series.

Hereâ€™s an example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series
data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])

# Using the sum() method
total = data.sum()

print(total)  # Output: 60
In this example, calling data.sum() returns the sum of the values in the Series, which is 60.

##  How to Install and Setup Projects

Create a new repo in Git Hub.  Make sure to include README when creating the new repo.

Clone the new repo to your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/hrawp/datafun-07-ml
```

Add a .gitignore file with:
## Python virtual environment.
```
.venv/
```

## Visual Studio Code settings and workspace.
```
.vscode/
```
added so .venv files will not be sent up to your repo.

## Create a virtual environement by running this command.
```
python -m venv .venv
```

## Activate the environment by running this command.
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## If the project uses Jupyter, include an entry in gitignore
```
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```
## Update the requirements.txt with libraries that need to be installed.



## Run the three Git commands to stange and transmit files to GitHub.
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "initial commit"
```
```
git push -u origin main
```


## install depedencies from requirements.txt
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
